## 🛠 How it Works

Aileron maps your complex directory structures into a streamlined, clickable interface. Simply use the plus icon to add your most-frequented folders or files.

1.  Click the **Add** option in menu bar.
2.  Select **"Add File/Folder"** from the menu.
3.  Browse to your folder or file and confirm.
4.  Input your shortcut button's name.
5.  Click Save button
6.  Your new button is now ready for use.
